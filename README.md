# Breaking-it

Autumn project of third year at the He-Arc 

## The project
The purpose of this project is to create an Android or IOS application that allows the user to break a glass with a sound that matches its resonance frequency. The user records the sound of the glass with the application, then the application computes the frequency of the sound and emits a sinusoid tone. Since the sound emitted by the application is the same frequency than the glass' resonance frequency, exposing the glass to this sound will make the glass vibrate. If the sound is powerful enough, the glass should break.
