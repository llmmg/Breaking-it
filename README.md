# Breaking-it

Autumn project of third year at the He-Arc 

## The project
The purpose of this project is to create an Android or IOS application that allow the user to break a glass with a sound that match the resonance frequency of the glass. 
The user record the sound of the glass with the application. Then the application compute the frequency of the sound and emit a sinusoid tone. As the sound emitted by the application is the same frequency than the glass resonance frequency, exposing the glass to this sound will make the glass vibrate. If the sound is powerful enough, the glass should break.
